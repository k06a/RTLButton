# RTLButton
UIButton subclass with image and title aligned Right To Left

You will be able to see RTLButton right in Xcode IB:

<img src="https://raw.github.com/k06a/RTLButton/master/screenshot.png" />

## Usage

Right now CocoaPods solution not works properly because of Xcdoe bug:

```
pod 'RTLButton'
```

So just copy source code to your project or add git submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/k06a/RTLButton RTLButton
```

## Contribute

Please develop `TTBButton` (Top To Bottom) class and `BTTButton` (Bottom To Top) subclass with inverse logic :)
